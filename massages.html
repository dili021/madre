                    </p>
                    <p>

                        <br>
                        - Promotes and maintains good health – promotes tissue health and
                        encourages health awareness.
                        <br>
                        - Stress management – helps relieve associated muscular tension and general
                        relaxation.

                        <br><br>
                        The different therapeutic massage techniques are extremely beneficial in the
                        treatment of rheumatic disorders and in the recovery and maintenance of the
                        functional capacity.

                    <p>
                        <span>Bio-energy</span> is life-energy. In India it's called <span>prana</span>, in China it's
                        called <span>chi</span>, in
                        ancient
                        Egypt it's <span>ka</span>, and African shamans call it <span>num</span>. Bio-energy therapy is
                        popularly known as
                        "Healing with hands" and
                        known and practiced for thousands of years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From the standpoint of energetic medicine, a lack of energy or the blockage of the flow of
                        energy through the body appears as discomfort, pain or sickness.
                        The therapist channels bio-energy to the patient, unblocks the flow of energy through his body
                        and restores energetic balance, which leads to the betterment of health and disappearance of the
                        problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Energy-therapeutic massage is a combination of a bio-energy therapy with a
                        massage. During this massage the therapist stops at blockage points, blocked muscles in the
                        body, laying his/her hands over them, promoting the flow of energy and unblocking them and
                        relaxing the muscle. The massage is then continued. This process is very soothing
                        and enjoyable,
                        and completely painless.

                    <h3>Lymph Drainage</h3>
                    <p>
                        Lymphatic massage is commonly referred to as lymphatic drainage. It is a gentle,
                        rhythmical massage performed by a specially trained therapist to stimulate the circulation of
                        lymph around the body.
                        This helps to rapidly speed up the removal of wastes and toxins from a sluggish
                        lymphatic system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lymphatic massage can be helpful for prevention of swelling after injury or surgery. It
                        is also thought to provide a major boost to the immune system.
                        Lymphatic Drainage aims to increase the efficiency of your lymphatic and circulatory
                        system. By reducing the volume of retained fluid and the pressure associated, it can
                        reduce the risk of impeded circulation.
                        It has also been shown to be beneficial in
                        post-operative conditions.

                        Massage during pregnancy has gained a lot of popularity in the western world in recent years. It
                        is known as
                        a valid and useful way to reduce pregnancy discomforts. However, it is really
                        important to find a qualified therapist.

                    <p>
                        - When done effectively, it reduces stress hormones within a
                        pregnant
                        woman’s body. It also increases the level of hormones which tend to be low when women are
                        depressed.
                        <br>
                        - Improved sleep due to feeling less muscle tension and
                        generally less
                        uncomfortable.
                        <br>
                        - It can improve the progression of labour with better health
                        outcomes for both the mother and the
                        baby. <br>

                        sore
                        back…
                        <br>
                        - Leads to muscle relaxation and relieves joint pain.
                        <br>
                        - Gives an opportunity to pregnant women to get some rest and completely
                        relax.

                    <p>
                        Relax massages are smooth, gentle, and flowing. They promote general
                        relaxation, relieve muscular tension, and improve circulation and range of movement.
                        However, relax massages are less effective than the deeper styles that work with soft
                        tissue.

                    <p>
                        (Wood Therapy) is a massage technique originating from Colombia and it is based on
                        using wooden anatomically made elements, which makes this therapy 100%
                        natural,
                        non-invasive and without any allergic reactions.
                        This therapy represents massage of the highest quality and it is intended for people
                        with disproportionately localized fat layers, excess body fluids, toxins in skin tissue and
                        cellulite.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This method is used for stimulation and rebalancing of energy,
                        reducing stress
                        levels
                        and relieving muscles and wrists of pain. Thanks to all the advantages, Maderotherapy
                        is also used in other fields, such as aesthetics.
                        Maderotherapy provides quick and visible results, that can be
                        often noticed already
                        between first and third session. Although, we recommend a full cycle of 10 sessions
                        for satisfactory results.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Treatments to be performed every day, or if client is hyper-sensitive, every other day.
                        Number of cycles needed depends from client to client.
                        Each session lasts 30-60min, depending on which parts of the body are covered. <br>
                        The oil we use for Maderotherapy is a blend of eco-organic essential oils, made
                        according to a special recipe. The oil has an anti-inflammatory
                        effect, boost metabolism
                        and
                        circulation, aids fat loss, release of toxins and excess liquids.
